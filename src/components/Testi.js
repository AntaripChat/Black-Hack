              Adrian and this team are always there to help and guide you. Being
              a part of and surrounded by like-minded people who aspire to
              become great developers is something you donâ€™t find often. I feel
              very fortunate to be a part of this program.

              Simply the best way to take your development skills to the next
              level. Adrian from JS Mastery already has the best free content
              out on the internet, but since joining the master class, my
              confidence in writing more complicated application features has
              skyrocketed. I cannot thank Adrian enough. I am now working as a
              software engineer while participating in the program, and the team
              environment he creates simulates what you will experience once you
              get a job. 10/10

              Adrian, I wanted to thank you for your React courses. I've
              personally learned a lot from them and landed a full-time job as a
              JavaScript developer two days ago. Keep doing what you're doing.
              Thank you!

              JS Mastery has been precisely what I was looking for. I have
              enjoyed the courses, and completing them filled many gaps that
              some other learning platforms brushed over or skipped entirely.
              10/10 would recommend.
